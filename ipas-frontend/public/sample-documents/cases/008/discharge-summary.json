  "hospital_course": "77-year-old male presented to ED with chest pain radiating to left arm. Initial ECG showed ST depression in inferior and lateral leads. Troponin elevated at 2.5 ng/mL. Patient was taken emergently to cardiac catheterization lab. Coronary angiography revealed 100% occlusion of distal left circumflex and 75% stenosis of RCA. Successful PCI performed with placement of drug-eluting stents to obtuse marginal and RCA. Post-procedure course uncomplicated. Follow-up echocardiogram showed preserved ejection fraction of 60-65% with Grade I diastolic dysfunction. Patient remained hemodynamically stable throughout hospitalization.",
