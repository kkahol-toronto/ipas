Associated symptoms include nausea, photophobia, and occasional dizziness. No fever, neck stiffness, or focal neurological symptoms. No recent head trauma or travel history. OTC medications have provided no relief.",

  "assessment": [
    "Headaches - Likely tension type headaches, but neuroimaging indicated to rule out intracranial pathology",

  "plan": [
    "Order MRI brain with contrast to rule out intracranial pathology",
    "Consider neurology referral if MRI abnormal",
    "Continue current medications (Lisinopril, Metformin, Atorvastatin)",
    "Follow-up in 2 weeks with MRI results",
    "Patient education regarding headache triggers and management"
